In a time where large firms are constantly competing to raise their bottom line and the battle for every ounce of profit, there does not seem to be an argument for them going out of their way to generate non-proprietary projects. However, the reality is quite the contrary, as we discussed within the class; the remarkable nature of the work by GNU and Stallman is that they have championed basic freedoms of a movement. A movement that is the foundation of much of today’s computing architecture. 

I find myself in awe at how they managed to have such significant forethought in a time of rapid development and a chance for tech fortunes. When one examines the historical leaders of the tech world, it is easy to look to Jobs, Gates and other magnates, but, perhaps the contributions of thought by community members like Torvald and Stallman dwarf that of them. This dichotomy follows the reading on the Cathedral and Bazaar as one can compare the contributions of Stallman and Torvald to that of the Bazaar approach while the notable tech giants are those of the Cathedral.
